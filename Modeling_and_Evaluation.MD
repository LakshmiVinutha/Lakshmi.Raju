## Jupyter Notebooks

The same code can also be run via notebooks. From AMLWorkbench, click File --> Open Command-Line Interface to launch the CLI shell in the project folder, then enter the following command:

```# first you need to install Jupyter Python package
C:\Temp\Iris> pip install notebook

# launch Jupyter server from the local project folder
C:\Temp\Iris> az ml notebook
```

This will start the notebook server and display a URL you can use to connect from any web browser on your machine (by default this is http://localhost:8888). Additionally, it also launches Jupyter web UI from this address using your default browser automatically as shown below. Create a new notebook as shown below.
