# File Logger

## 1.	Objectives

The aim of this lab is to log chat conversations to a file using middleware. Excessive I/O operations can result in slow responses from the bot. In this lab, the global events are leveraged to perform efficient logging of chat conversations to a file. We will continue to extend the code from the previous lab.
